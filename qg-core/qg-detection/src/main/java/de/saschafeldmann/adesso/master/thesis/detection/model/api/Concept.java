 * Interface for all detection concepts.<br />
 * A concept reveals special semantics that was extracted based upon a a special sequence of named entities and / or part of speech tags
 * within a given {@link LearningContent} or based on a meaning that was obtained from external ontologies.<br />
 * Following [Reiter] in his proposal of a natural language generation system, a concept is the result of the document planner which
 * did the tasks of the content determination ("what information should be communicated?").<br />
 * See: Reiter, E., Dale, R., & Feng, Z. (2000). Building natural language generation systems (Vol. 33). Cambridge: Cambridge university press.
